# IT-AcadEMI
IT AcadEMI is the IT club of Mohammadia School of Enginners and the first IT club in Morocco tha was created at 1999.
I was a member of the club and i wanted to make a tribute to the club and to participate in its history.
I developped this website to be the officail website of the club.
It is responsive so I made it as a PWA to work on desktop and mobile.
## It is hosted on Netlify on this [URL](https://itacademi.netlify.app/).
